python-camlistore
=================

``python-camlistore`` is a Python client library for `Camlistore`_, which
aims to be "your personal storage system for life".

At present this client library is pretty experimental, much like Camlistore
itself. It provides a basic interface to the low-level blob storage system
and to parts of the search system, but with an interface that will probably
change as Camlistore evolves and as the client interface design is refined.
