python-camlistore
=================

This is a Python library for interacting with Camlistore. The intent is to
provide an interface that provides the same levels of abstraction as Camlistore
itself, to enable the implementation of both tools that operate on Camlistore's
guts and tools that provide new functionality in terms of Camlistore.
